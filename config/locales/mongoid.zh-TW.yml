          message: "Document(s) not found for class %{klass} with id(s) %{missing}."
          summary: "When calling %{klass}.find with an id or array of ids, each
            parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be
            raised. The search was for the id(s): %{searched} (%{total} total)
            and the following ids were not found: %{missing}."
          resolution: "Search for an id that is in the database or set
            the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false,
            which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when
            searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching
            for multiples."
